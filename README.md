## Description

I wanted to create an easy to use Node command line application for a manager to be able to consolodate contact information for their entire team. This application will generate an index.html file that has all of the information the user input when prompted in the command line.

## Installation

Simply clone my repository and open up the integrated terminal in your VSCode.

## Usage

Once your integrated terminal is open, run the program using the command "node index.js" and input the information following the prompts.
