## Description

I wanted to create an easy to use Node command line application for a manager to be able to consolodate contact information for their entire team. This application will generate an index.html file that has all of the information the user input when prompted in the command line.

## Installation

Simply clone my repository and open up the integrated terminal in your VSCode.

## Usage

Once your integrated terminal is open, run the program using the command "node index.js" and input the information following the prompts.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative file path, add it to your README using the following syntax:

![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)

Uses the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4)
Uses the [Jest package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest) for a suite of unit tests.
